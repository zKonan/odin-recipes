This is an HTML recipes project. The goal is to practice all of the HTML knowledge you have acquired. The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website won’t look very pretty by the time you’ve finished but it’s important to keep in mind that this project is just to build your HTML chops; we will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.
